I cannot wait to see @RoomTheMovie I'm so happy one of my favorite books is gonna be on the big screen.❤️
Seriously I think I might die here at work. I'm drunk and miserable and my eyes won't stay open. Fuck my friends for keeping me up all night
2015 has been such a crazy year for me.. I'm ready to see what 2016 has in store!
I moan and groan for twenty minutes when I wake up before I'm able to form words and speak

@Michael_Aranda @BenVolin I'm not saying they're a BAD defense. I'm saying they're overrated. Their O wins games. And that's not a problem.

@MikeBlakey13 it's no wonder I'm over Christmas half way through December!

@DMashak I am awake, and I cherish human life. We need a govt by the people, for the people, and conservatives/teaparty don't do it.
im so tired of all of this
im gonna cry i'll be with my dogs in roughly 12 hours
I still don't like that CFG has given money to Cruz, but now that Cruz has aligned himself pretty much 100% with Trump, I'm more comfortable

I'm just tossing out polls to procrastinate. Who's the best of these singers that write for your fave artist?

@sai_itaintso like sai fr im over everything. Im too young to be stressed over dumb shit
@brianbeutler I'm skeptical that polling that's 1) this early and 2) in Iowa reflects make-up of GOP primary electorate writ large,
Outside of Evangelical-land, Cruz can never compete with Trump.  But he can be MiniTrump #2 and I'm good with that.
@FaZeKay kay follow me i am a huge fan!
