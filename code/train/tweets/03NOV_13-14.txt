Legit I feel like I'm flirting with everyone who's tweet I favorite.
I'm a pretty simple dude when it comes to social media. I don't care about most changes. But my visceral hatred of these "likes"/❤️ is real
That Tokyo snapchat makes me want to go even more now.
We get hearts instead of stars now? I mean it makes me feel less like a teacher grading tweets with gold stars.
Im not doctor but im pretty sure it's not normal to have strep for the third time in the past couple months 😪
like im really happy but at the same time really sad ??
I haven't been eating much and so in turn I'm so dizzy rn I don't even want to get up.
I think I'm confused. Since when does a 'like' have a heart symbol? Let's not confuse lust with love @Twitter #SocialMedia
Why is Twitter now likes instead of favorites I'm confused
I'm a fan of the new heart vs star #likes more interactive and interesting. Shows where @twitter is headed. You?
I can never tell when I'm being hit on lol

Being over the age of 18 doesn't make you an adult. I'm tired of all of these "adults" acting like children. Disappointing.
Trying to keep everyone happy when I'm not,, is very hard ,,and getting harder .....
The amount of support I've received from my sisters during this hard time, reminds me why I'm so lucky to be apart of the ZTA

Idk how or why I'm growing out of pants this fast it's ridiculous
This is unbelievable. I'm actually in shock right now..

&amp; you throw your head back laughin like a little kid. I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, cause he never did.
I'm a big fan of the switch to hearts. More accurately reflects what they are. When I was new, I thought "Favorite" meant "Bookmark"/"Save"
I feel like poo poo today 💩

@annajeanette @giraffesnax me too pls I am beautiful and hungry

I'm fairly certain @JohnMayer's music speaks to my soul. I've played Neon countless times, it never gets old. Always buzzing just like neon.
Since I only really look at Twitter on my phone I am spared seeing the hearts, which appear to be a crime against humanity.
I'm so embarrassed rn
Being able to afford a two bedroom apartment, a nice car, insurance, and everything else I need at 19 on my own makes me so proud
