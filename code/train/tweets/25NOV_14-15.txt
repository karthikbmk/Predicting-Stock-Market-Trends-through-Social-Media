I feel like half of One Tree Hill is filmed in the hospital
I'm in Carbondale and hate it

@daviesbj @amitabhchandra2 do you think deaths from prostate cancer will rise? (I am willing to put money on the other side of that bet)
So if u force me to swear at you it's because I'm infected of your love.
Only the people who I am the most passionate about do I show thatto
I'm too straight forward for a majority of American society.
I'm incapable of making people happy.
