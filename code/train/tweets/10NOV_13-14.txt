It's days like today that I'm especially grateful to have attended an institution like Texas A&amp;M where discourse prevails over reactionism.
I guess I just have to forget my feelings again and act like I'm the shit
Best case scenario, though?? Heh, well the sky's the limit 😊 (I'm optimistic so I'm already looking at the upside)
