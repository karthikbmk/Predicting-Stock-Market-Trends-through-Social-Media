Sometimes I'm taken to my past
Sometimes I wish I was dead
Sometimes I want to slip into a void
But only sometimes.
Practice was the worst it has been yet and I'm pretty sure the team can agree. Mf Russo made us run like all practice. Like to piss me off.

1 thing I know: the difference between real and fake.
