So glad I'm almost done with homework
Just got hit straight in the ovary with a dodgeball in gym class... I am personally victimized by these kids on a weekly basis.
School just makes me want to be more of a bitch
I'm clearly on the toilet person who keeps trying to open locked door. Shake that handle one more time and I'm getting violent.
@T_Blood51 not the person I expected to see this tweet from at all but I'm really glad to see someone else saying it.
