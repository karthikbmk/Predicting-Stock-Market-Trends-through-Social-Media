I know I have my own shortcoming but I cut all ties w/ someone if I'm dating someone. Even if it is a small thing like social media stuff.
It honestly makes me sick how people are so selfish and think everything is about them
I'm getting real selfish.. Life's to short to be worried about helping everyone, especially when no one is helping you.

Physically I seem fine mentally I'm destroyed I kill myself over nothing and I know I'm worth so much more
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said 
That love is watching someone die 
So who's gonna watch you die 🎧
I hate the drama involved with leaving the house, especially when I am outnumbered and no one seems to be able to dress themselves today.
I wish I could just get paid to edit people's essays because I'm so good at that and it would require so little work on my part.
I really want like 20 mozzarella sticks but I'm too tired from last night to get out of bed
I'm gonna make my pin tweet, tweets and shit that make me happy later ok bye
@Marilynajohnson That's the only TV show where I wish I had a map in front of me while I'm watching it.
This year, I'm thankful that I'm divorced!
I'm sick of having a bang . I want my hair all one length
I'm not saying the way we get news is wrong but I had to watch a 30 second ad with the Muppets in order to see the Laquan McDonald footage.
I'm so sick of driving places
I feel cute today
Beau came over at 8:30 in the morning so I could help write a paper &amp; I'm actually getting super stressed
