Every time im in a good mood something or someone kills my mood
@LivetheStreamFF @CDCarter13 Mike Pettine has some blame here too as I'm SURE YOU ADDED MCCOWN AS A STREAMER. 457 on Ravens last time out

I cannot believe I'm defending the Browns on this, but I am. Johnny said he wouldn't do exactly what he did. Pettine had no choice.
