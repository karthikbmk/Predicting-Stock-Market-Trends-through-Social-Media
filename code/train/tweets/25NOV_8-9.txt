If Im really getting flu for thanksgiving I'll cry. Real tears.
My dad bought me this gigantic apple pie and said "I'm broke so this is what you'll be eating for the next few days"
Getting out of bed when the alarm goes off has gotten tons easier since I switched from alarm to Fox radio. I am a genius, maybe?
Now that I'm 18 I can start my gun collection ❤
Sometimes I think about you and just want to say I'm sorry I let our friendship down..
I hate when people try to tell me what I can/can't do w my life, if it's something I'm willing to work for, then it's obtainable in my eyes
I can't even explain how excited I am to eat tomorrow
"I keep ahsking my dohd to drive me downtown, and I feel like I've just kind of exhausted thaaht. As an optionnnn." FUCK I hate you.

I asked 6 years old the question: what are you thankful for? The powerful respond was from a girl: "I am thankful for my life."
