reasons why I'm so happy during Nov and Dec: sweaters, leggings, KU basketball, School breaks (which means NO MATH!), and lots of food.
I'm the boss in the fucking game. Everybody knows my name.
Maybe I'm too old for snapchat because I have no clue how to use it. #30fail
I'm not going to trip over a girl like you simply because my mom raised me better.
I am a liberal and Obama supporter, but I don't agree with everything he says and does. RW teabaggers would follow Trump over the cliff.
