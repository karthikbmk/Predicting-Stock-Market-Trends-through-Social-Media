Every year I'm a little bit more disappointed that "Black Friday" is now a thing in Canada.

don't get me started on "Cyber Monday"
I'm troubled by allegations that my alma mater did a disservice to its female students, and that it might be an overarching theme.
I am not down with "I am more enlightened than you Twitter,".
Shine the light, share some knowledge, talk less shit about how smart you are.
@IAmDaDude Yassssss 😂 I'm pressed lol
I'm trying really hard here...
I admit that I'm neither brave or skilled enough to go Black Friday shopping 😶
@ASFried  Watching the Black Friday clip makes me want to call the video a fake.... Seems staged to me
