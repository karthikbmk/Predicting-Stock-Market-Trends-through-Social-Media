My puppy saves me if I'm ever sad. Even though she hates me, if I'm upset she knows it and comes to lay next to me❤️ dogs are so special
U might hate yourself for falling back to sleep, but I hate myself because I guilt myself with the amount of money I'm paying to go to class
I'd rather fuck who I want than kill who I am told to
@jryanncheer I'm not looking to be banned from your place!
