I'm not a violent person anymore. But if you disrespect the women I love in my life, my eyes are gonna go red and there's nothing u can do.
Drake really makes me wanna solve tangent equations

I trust the timing of my life but sometimes unexpected news makes me spazz tf out....
I'm not lying, I live better, sleep better, love better &amp; I'm genuinely happy. And when we have different views we talk rather than argue.
