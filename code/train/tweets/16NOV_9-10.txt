The twitter fight between @JohnLegere and @realDonaldTrump makes me proud to have t-mobile
I don't talk to no one &amp; I dont plan on it , I'm trying to become a boss for my lil me 🤑
Listening carefully to #Obama's press conf. at G20, I'm confident he fully understands #ISIS but not willing to pay price of destroying it.
I'm always the one that walks away with a lesson to learn instead of happiness to enjoy &amp; im so fucking sick of it.
I hate when people ask me what I'm doing tomorrow like I don't even know what I'm doing right now.
Set my alarm for 8:45. Here I am, still in bed
