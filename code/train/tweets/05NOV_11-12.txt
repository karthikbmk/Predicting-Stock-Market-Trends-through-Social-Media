I feel like it's important to have some self confidence in yourself bc doubting yourself 24/7 won't get you anywhere
People forget I'm forever winning. I just stay low key with my shit. 💅
I'm a petty, tit for tat ass broad and idgaf
Ironically I'm the only 'black' at the gig so whenever a Rap song comes on pandora I feel like the whole place 👀 me 😩😂
