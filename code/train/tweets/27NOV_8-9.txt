@_Philly_Talk @Alyssadelphia7 @PHSportsGoddess I feel like I'm right, but my alternative guess is los basketball
I'm the only girl at work today so I can poop all I want
If I walk into work today and Christmas music is already playing, I promise I'm walking right back out.
really hope I'm not the only one who always wakes up nervous. it's so weird
I'm so bored
I've decided that it is not worth the energy of driving and getting ready and keep patient with people so I'm not shopping
What I feel like today --&gt; 🐋
Back to work today 😞 I'm tired and my throat is getting sore 😞
Im sooo damn grateful man
The amount of fat and disgusting I feel today physically hurts
Thought I wouldn't be so hungry after all that food. Alas, I am wrong
I'm tired of having dreams like this.
I have to put pants on because these guys are at my house. I'm like mad about this

I'm in possibly one of the worst moods ever lmao.
I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving! Be careful it's there shopping! I'm sitting this one out!
@211Pine Sadly, it was on consumerism and identity. I'm sure has been cock rockers would have been much more fun!
my mom thinks she don't gotta cook cause we still have leftovers but I'm not about to keep eating turkey and shit everyday
Literally watch out, I'm probably going to die
I've got 8 hours between before my next shift I'm fucking dead night
Well Tiki and Strahan love white women. So I'm sure they approve. @BlkPoliticSport @babengalsfan @SowaTheArrogant
First year in forever that I'm not working a Black Friday shift and I'm feeling pretty good
I'm exhausted and can finally get some rest, but I can't seem to fall asleep.. 🙄😲😴
I'm fresh like Manny , that's why a fuck n---a can't stand me 🎶🎶
We've reached the point in our family vacation where every response is "why are you looking at me" &amp; "shut up I'm going to kill you"
@jeauxsmeaux bless im ready man !!!
Guys I'm single.... No I don't date him.... Yes I liked him.... No he doesn't like me.... No we never dated.... No we don't talk...
It was heartbreaking seeing my boyfriend and best friends all together while I'm 4 hours away feeling sick as hell. 😞
I'm dead
What I am excited for today --&gt; Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich 😍🦃
I always wonder what kind of person people think I am. Usually their wrong
Orlando is live tomorrow on snapchat too bad Im not going to a theme park
The fact that I can hear the neighbors bed squeaking makes me want to throw up. I'm about to sock the fuckin wall
I'm surprised today is still allowed to be called Black Friday, it's 2015 how has no one said it's too racist yet?
I'm still upset that my cowboys lost 😭😭😭😭
The fact that it's so freezing cold in the mornings when I go to work is ridiculous. I'm so tired of being freezing.
@JudyWEdu Are you free Thursday am? I was just about to tweet at you - I am an insane knitter and the mugs are adorable!

@Tosheem I'm an idiot
Honestly, there aren't that many people out today, like I'm surprised at how quiet the mall is.
im sick of FAKE super peppy and positive people who turn out to be jealous asshats
Can't believe that, for the first time in 25 years, I'm not working today! Not shopping, just chilling with family and friends
I am so glad I'm not working on Black Friday this year 🙌🏼😁

I put it all on the line that's what made me .. Mama was drinking while she was pregnant that's why i'm crazy 🙃💸
Only way I'm shopping on Black Friday is if what I want is guaranteed there and FREE
I feel like it's the afternoon since I've been at work since 2am
The reason why I'm trying to get my shit straight and be careful more is because I know the next girl I date.. I'm marrying
No matter how long I stay up till, I'm up by 8 the next day.
I'm an east Atlanta nigga, we don't really like strangas

I'm in such an awful mood omfg
@HornyFranta yeah I know have the soft cover and hard cover and I'm dying
I never do black Friday shopping at the mall, there's online shopping for a reason. I'm not tryna get in a fight over a shirt.

I'm actually a big car guy but I'm quiet about it as I'm mostly a fan of aesthetics as opposed to performance.
I feel like the American people have the right to know what their troops are doing in other countries.
Mocking #BlackFriday shoppers is the new vice of choice for Black Friday. And yes I am always ahead in the hierarchy of feeling superior.
My friends are freezing but I'm super comfy in this weather
My poor baby is so sick 😭😭 &amp; I can't really do much bc I am sick too. I feel so bad :-(

Honestly I am so much better than that
Mayb I will b nice and order #InsideOut for them while I'm zoning .. mayb .. that will last all of ten minutes b4 it's an argument ..
Some believe #BlackFridayMatters is important. I'm hoping #AllFridaysMatter. Am I misunderstanding something? @CloydRivers will know..
I'm feeling different about shit tbh
Riding the train makes me upset
I'm tried of thinking that one person actually cares when deep down you know they don't... No ones got time for that...
No one knows how excited I am to see Flegan😍😍😍
Tired of being played with mike if I'm the fucking bop toy 😂😅😔
I am not shitting you when I say the temperature has dropped like 20-25 degrees since I left my house this morning.

I'm always thinking of what's next and how to be in a good space... for me, food gives people a reason to make amends
I always think about whether or not my 10 year old self would be proud of where I am mentally. Lame shit, I know lol
I swear I'm watching a saleswoman flirt with my mom in an attempt to get her to buy a pair of jeans
*Going to dads room*

It makes me sick to my stomach that so many Americans will spend hundreds on Black Friday and many won't give even $1 to help refugees.
